# BIJLI, Chak De Chargers - Submission
<h2 align="center">
A crowd-sourced EV Charger Finder and Trip Planner app, akin to Tesla's "Go Anywhere" It lets users discover and add third-party EV chargers while planning electric journeys with ease
</h2> 

#### Team Name - Bijli, Chak De Chargers
#### Problem Statement -  The lack of an accessible, comprehensive, and user-driven platform for locating third-party EV chargers and effectively planning electric vehicle journeys hinders the adoption and convenience of electric mobility.
#### Team Leader Email - xshaburu@gmail.com

## A Brief of the Prototype:

An innovative EV Charger Discovery and Route Planning App, akin to Tesla's renowned technology "Go Anywhere". Unlike Tesla's proprietary network, this app is a collaborative platform where users can contribute and locate third-party EV chargers across the map.

Whether you're an EV owner or enthusiast, it empowers you to effortlessly discover and add EV chargers while planning your electric journeys with precision and ease.
